        <h1>Join Us in Supporting Girls in Math</h1>

Women represent half of the U.S. college-educated workforce, but <b>only 25% of the workforce in computer and mathematical sciences</b> (NSF, Science &amp; Engineering Indicators, 2016). Since 2007, Girls' Angle, a registered 501(c)3 organization, has been committed to fostering and nurturing girls' interest in mathematics and empowering them to be able to tackle any field no matter the level of mathematical sophistication. We accomplish this through a weekly math club for girls of all abilities and specialized programs through schools and community centers. <b>To date, over 5,000 girls have developed their math skills and confidence with Girls' Angle.</b>
 
With your support, the 2018 SUMITs, full-day math collaborations for girls in grades 6 through 10, will achieve the following goals:
<ul>
<li>build girls' confidence and ability so that they can tackle any level of mathematics they set their minds to</li>
<li>promote collaboration, rather than competition, to strengthen problem solving ability</li>
<li>empower girls to organize and drive technical solutions, creating future leaders.</li>
</ul>

<!-- There are three levels of sponsorship for the 2018 SUMITs with the following benefits:

      <blockquote><i>"Girls need to know they can do math and science as well as anyone else, and I think this is a really cool,
collaborative thing to do."</i> - Girls' Angle math collaboration participant, 2017<br>
        <br>
Women represent half of the U.S. college-educated workforce, but <b>only 25% of the workforce in computer and mathematical sciences.</b>
(NSF, Science & Engineering Indicators, 2016)  Since 2007, Girls' Angle, a registered 501(c)3 organization, has been committed
to fostering and nurturing girls' interest in mathematics and empowering them to be able to tackle any field no matter the
level of mathematical sophistication.  We accomplish this through a weekly math club for girls of all abilities and specialized
programs through schools and community centers.  To date, over 5,000 girls have built their math skills and confidence
with Girls' Angle.<br>
        <br>
<i>In 2018, we want to expand our reach through a three-part series of 'SUMITs,' intensive full-day girls'
math collaborations, and we need your help.</i><br>
        <br>
Our aim is for these SUMITs to be galvanizing events for mathematically-curious girls in grades 6 through 10.
We aspire to:<br>
<ul>
<li>build girls' confidence and ability so that they can tackle any level of mathematics they set their minds to;</li>
<li>promote collaboration, rather than competition, to strengthen problem solving ability;</li>
<li>empower girls to organize and drive technical solutions, creating future leaders.</li>
</ul>
Girls' Angle has carefully built the groundwork for this series of three full-scale one-day collaborations through
designing and running over 100 smaller-scale versions as well as two larger pilot collaborations in 2012 and 2013.
In these full-day events, girls put their minds together and tackle challenging problems and puzzles with the
common goal of solving a multi-layered mathematical mystery.  Every participant of the two pilot collaborations
rated the overall experience a 9 or 10 out of 10, with some declaring it the best experience of their life.<br>
        <br>
Our goal is to raise $50,000 through sponsorship to empower over 100 more girls in mathematics and build a
framework that will ultimately run nationally, presenting an alternative to the numerous competition-based
math events that exist.  Our corporate sponsorships range from $2,000 - 20,000 and include sponsor credit
in our program, website, and SUMIT t-shirts - as well as the gratitude of 100+ girls! You can make your donation via check to:
