<!-- <b>Welcome!</b> -->

<!--Registration for SUMIT 2020 opens at 2 pm on Sunday, February 9, 2020.-->

<!-- Special notice due to SUMIT 2020 cancellation from COVID-19 -->

It is with great disappointment that SUMIT 2020 has been cancelled to comply with MIT's COVID-19 policy.<br><br>

Yesterday, MIT announced its <a href="http://web.mit.edu/covid19/">official policy on COVID-19</a>. In it, it states explicitly:
"To protect children and older visitors to campus, we ask that you:
Cancel or reschedule all K12 programs and visits to be held at MIT from now through May 15."
This, unfortunately, leaves us no choice but to cancel SUMIT 2020.<br><br>

We will refund all of the registration fees. If by Monday, March 9, 2020, you have not gotten a refund, please let us know.<br><br>

We were so looking forward to witnessing participants rally together and overcome big challenges and rescue the world by solving math problems of all shapes and sizes, and we hope to have that opportunity at the next SUMIT, which we hope will be SUMIT 2021.<br><br>

11th graders: Next year, you are all welcome to be involved on the staff side of next year's event.<br><br>

If you can't stand not having this math collaboration experience, we can still try to do one at your school or a local library. We've run some 150 math collaborations at schools, libraries, and other venues. Contact your school officials or your local library to see if they'd be willing to have us over to run a math collaboration. (Thanks to a grant from Microsoft Research, the first such event we run at a school is free of charge.)<br><br>

We apologize for any disappointment this cancellation causes, but hope you understand.<br><br>

To all SUMIT 2020 registrants: Keep on thinking about math!.

<!--If you are interested in participating in SUMIT 2020, you've come to the right place.<br><br>

You'll be registered on a first-come-first-serve-basis.<br><br>

SUMIT 2020 will take place twice, once on Saturday, April 4, 2020 and once on Sunday, April 5, 2020.
You may only participate in one of these events.
<br><br>
To begin the registration process, fill out and submit <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1okvzUtjWU4Inn4550gY60OTU2ZjpIrQV9TdFL9W5JgQ/edit" target="_blank">the Google form at this link.</a> (The form should open in a new tab.)
<br><br>

Participants will be charged a $75 registration fee. The registration fee will be waived for students who demonstrate financial need. <b>Please wait for an email confirming your registration before submitting your registration fee.</b> If you get a spot, you will be notified by email and be sent a registration packet and a link to PayPal. Please complete the registration packet and pay the $75 registration fee using the PayPal link in the email you received or in the registration packet. You will have 3 business days to return the registration packet and pay the registration fee, or your spot will be forfeited to the next person on the wait list.

<!--SUMIT 2019 registration is now closed. We apologize if you registered but did not get a spot. Remember, it has nothing to do with your math ability. We simply ran out of spots. We hope you'll make it next year.<br><br>
