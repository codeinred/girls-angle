          <p>Math Collaborations are events that grew out of activities at the Girls' Angle Club. We have now hosted over 150
             such events at schools and libraries, including one for an icebreaker activity for Harvard math concentrators.
             We also ran 6 large-scale Math Collaborations called
             <a href="SUMIT/SUMIT.html">SUMIT</a>.
             <a href="math_collaborations.html#mctestimonials">See testimonials below.</a>
             <a href="https://girlsangle.wordpress.com/2016/02/24/math-collaborations/">Also read this blog post by Vincent Marino of Pollard Middle School</a> and <a href="https://girlsangle.wordpress.com/2019/03/01/a-students-perspective-on-a-math-collaboration/">this article by a participant in a middle school Math Collaboration</a>.</p>

          <p>Math Collaborations are highly flexible and can be made for groups of various sizes, ability levels, and grades.
             We've created events for 3 participants up to 175, and for students in PreK through high school.
             Most have been all-girl, but some have been all-boy or co-ed. We
             can design the event to last anywhere from half an hour to a full day, though most have
             lasted 2 hours.</p>

          <p>The Math Collaboration is a mathematically-intense alternative to the Math Competition. Unlike
             Math Competitions, Math Collaborations are fully collaborative. Participants win or lose together as a unit and have
             every incentive to communicate well and share their ideas. Because Math Collaborations are done
             in the open, we can, if desired, make the content deeper than that found on the typical
             math competition.</p>

          <p>Math Collaborations can be arranged for a variety of settings.
             We have already organized long-distance events, such
             as one that took place at the Fitzjohn Primary School in London, England.</p>

          <p>Contact us if you would like to discuss the possibility of having us host a Math Collaboration
             for your organization.</p>

          <p>Girls' Angle thanks Microsoft Research for their generous, continued financial support for our Math Collaboration program.</p>

            <p class="quote">"...really fun when you got a bunch of people with varying areas of background knowledge to
              contribute answers... The math problems themselves were really stimulating and a good mix of high school and college math.
              It seemed like for each problem, there was at least one person within the participants who had the ability to solve it,
              and I think the emphasis on collaboration made us both put forward our strengths..."</p>

              a guilt-free, competition-less ethos that encourages experimentation and development of problem-solving skills.

            <p class="quote">"We hosted Ken for the Girl's Angle Math Collaboration at the Cary Memorial Library in Lexington.
              I was doubtful that we could convince a group of pre-teens to come to the library to do two hours of math in August,
              but it turned out to be one of the best programs of the summer. We were all screaming with excitement during the challenges.
              By the end of the program, all of the girls were talking about how much fun they'd had, but more importantly, I could clearly
              see that each of the girls walked away that afternoon feeling more confident and self-assured than they had been when they
              began. I hope that we are able to offer this program again in the future. Our patrons loved it!"</p>

            <p class="quote">"Ken recently hosted a Girls' Angle event for my Girl Scout troop in Brighton, MA. I have a blended
              troop with girls aged 11-18 and it is often very hard to find activities that keep all of the girls engaged and excited
              I was so impressed with Ken's activities and his easy way with all of the girls. Not only did the activities keep the
              girls absorbed, but Ken was able to draw in some of the more reserved girls as well. For example, one of the older girls
              kept saying that she was no good at math and that she wasn't able to solve any of the problems. Ken found a logic problem
              that was more suited to her abilities and helped walk her through how to solve it. She may not admit it, but I think she
              was very proud of herself when she figured out the solution! At the end of the event the girls all said that they would
              love to have Ken come in for another event next year."</p>

            <p class="quote">"The Math Collaboration was one of the favorite activities our Troop of Cadettes (6th graders)
              completed this year. As soon as we finished they all asked when they could do it again! I can't think of a better compliment.
              I was excited to bring this opportunity to our troop. The girls were instantly intrigued by the treasure box.
              After receiving minimal instructions they were quick to self-organize and eagerly jumped into their adventure.
              This activity truly embodied the skills we want to encourage as part of Girl Scouts. The girls realized that if they worked
              together and communicated they would have more success with the math challenges. As they completed questions, it was great
              to see them encourage each other to keep going. Ken did a great job tailoring the adventure to our girls' age and skill levels.
              They definitely felt challenged. And they were incredibly proud of what they accomplished at the end of the adventure.
              We can't wait for the next one!"</p>

            <p class="quote">"The girls all engaged in the work right away and with an intensity that I hadn't expected
              to see on a Friday afternoon right after a full day of school. They organized themselves. I wasn't the coach-
              I was the spectator. And everyone found a way to contribute. They worked together in a  fashion that acknowledged
              individual differences but was nevertheless very supportive. One girl would propose a solution with a flash of insight
              and another would patiently check it with long division. Some girls would tackle the individual problems while others
              would search for patterns in the results which allowed them to decode the final challenge.</p>
            <p class="quote">The exercise taught not just math but also organization as they worked out a system of checking
              each others' work. It also taught strategic thinking as they were blocked by a particularly challenging problem of the
              first phase of the puzzle. Many books, chairs, and markers, accompanied by a lot of hard thought, were devoted to that
              problem, but it would not yield to analysis. Instead they found a way around it as they were able to fit other pieces
              of the puzzle into place that let them decode the final challenge. The final challenge was a great culmination to the event.
              When they finally worked out the solution, they were very proud of their accomplishment. Before we left, the girls wrote the
              final challenge problem on the board so everyone in the class will be sure to see it on Monday.</p>
            <p class="quote">Last but perhaps not least they seemed to have a lot of fun with a great group of peers."</p>

            <p class="quote">"The math challenges led for us by Girls' Angle founder Ken Fan have been remarkably
              effective in teaching my middle school students 21st century skills: critical thinking, communication,
              creativity, and collaboration. Ken's assiduous organization of the puzzles and knowledge of when
              to intervene allow for the girls to dig in with minimal upfront direction. The joy and empowerment
              the girls experience from continually getting themselves "unstuck" throughout the process has been palpable.
              After a full school day plus an extra two and a half hours of solving math puzzles, the girls are exhausted
              but totally pumped. This is the best of what math can be!"</p>

            <p class="quote">"As a middle school educator with almost a decade of experience, I am constantly looking
              to provide opportunities where my students are forced to work cooperatively rather than competitively.
              I am also always focused on providing my female students with situations to challenge themselves in math
              and build their confidence.<p>
            <p class="quote">For both of these reasons I was thrilled to have Girls' Angle host a math treasure hunt
              for a group of seventh grade (and two eighth grade) female math students at my school during the winter.
              The girls signed up to stay at school during an early release day.  I was concerned about whether
              my students would remain engaged for the entire event as giving up time with friends for extra math is
              not typically well received with middle school-aged girls.  I was surprisingly thrilled with the outcome.
              The girls organized themselves almost immediately into smaller groups to break up the work with no direction
              from any adults.  They then went on to display dogged determination for the entire two hour time limit of the
              treasure hunt.  Their teamwork and perseverance were rewarded as they unlocked the treasure chest with less
              than a minute left in the hunt, earning the prizes within.</p>
            <p class="quote">The treasure hunt provided a unique setting where student success was predicated on each member
              of the group working for a common goal.  This forced the students to communicate effectively and share their
              individual ideas with the team.  It was amazing to watch students extend themselves, share ideas, ask questions,
              and experiment without any prodding.</p>
            <p class="quote">One of the most rewarding parts of the event was the response from my students in the days
               following.  The girls were so proud of what they achieved and the confidence that the event instilled in
               them was evident for the remainder of the school year.  They loved that they did not need adult help to
               accomplish the goal, and they definitely loved the prizes they won.</p>

            <p class="quote">"This past July, Ken Fan organized a Girls' Angle Math Collaboration for the middle school
              girls who participated in the Tech Savvy Program hosted by the
              <a href="http://www.bostongirlsstem.org" target="_blank">Boston Area Girls STEM Collaborative</a>.
              Ken constructed a complex math "riddle" which the girls could only decode by solving smaller math-related
              problems that unlocked the coordinates and combination they would need to discover what was in a locked
              box. This activity was a very fun and lively way for the girls to focus on complex mathematical
              problems for an extended period of time.</p>
            <p class="quote">Rather than receiving lengthy and overly-detailed instructions in the beginning, the girls
              were only given a small set of general rules (i.e. no outside help from their counselors or any other
              authority figure) and were then left to their own devices to navigate the rest of the hunt within a
              limited time period. The girls needed to use their organizational and leadership skills to solve the
              problems as fast as possible. After a short period of chaos, they organized themselves into groups
              of 2 to 3 girls to work on each problem. Girls who didn't like a particular problem were free to move
              on to another problem that was more appealing to them. Solving the problems required the use of a very
              broad spectrum of skills- from spatial reasoning to statistics, so it was possible for each girl to
              gravitate to solving a puzzle that corresponded to her own personal skills, interests and problem-solving
              nature.</p>
            <p class="quote">Activities included a game of "mathematics charades," and some simple combinatorics.
              Towards the end, many of the girls were using fairly complex algebra and solving systems of equations,
              which are generally high school level math skills. When they got close to the end and only had a few more
              problems left to solve to unlock the "treasure chest," they all collaborated effectively on the
              remaining problems, acknowledging one another's ideas rather than simply talking over one another.
              It was inspiring to see how the girls were able to self-organize and successfully achieve the end goal.
              It was a creative and engaging way to have fun with mathematics!"</p>
